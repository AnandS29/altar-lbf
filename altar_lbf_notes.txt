This document contains details on edits made to create the new altar environmnet on top of lbf.

1. First was adding new pngs of apple to represent different berries - now there are multiple possible coloured apples that agents can eat
2. Making the max number of steps 1000
3. The game doesn't end when there aren't any apples left, instead we keep respawning apples at the end of each step to remake any eaten apples
4. All apples are level 1, so no cooperation is necessary, and max player level is 1
5. Select a colour to represent a poison apple (poisoning can't be seen by any players) - keep poison apple constant for now (so no resetting for each episode)
6. Added poisoned attribute to Player object (not observable to agents)
7. Added poisoned agent png (poisoned but not yet suffering health effects) and unhealthy agent png (just for visualization purpose - not observed by agents)


Do we need to get rid of penalty when we add punishment? We don't want agents punishing others into helping them?
Do we want to normalize the reward?
